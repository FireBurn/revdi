# revdi

A from-scratch **Rust** reimplementation of DisplayLink's
[`evdi`](https://github.com/DisplayLink/evdi) — both the kernel module *and* the
userspace library — targeting DisplayLink DL3 docks (e.g. the Dell D6000). It is
a drop-in replacement for the stock C `evdi` + `libevdi`: the closed-source
DisplayLinkManager (DLM) loads it unchanged.

The module is written against the in-progress
[Rust DRM/KMS bindings](https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/) (Lyude Paul's safe
mode-object layer) and drives a virtual DRM display that DLM pulls pixels from,
exactly like the C `evdi` does through its own private ioctl ABI.

Replacing `libevdi` and `evdi.ko` leaves one closed component in the stack: the
`DisplayLinkManager` binary itself, which does the dock's HDCP/control-plane
handshake and encodes the video. `chimera/` is the beginning of a replacement for
*that* — a userspace rig that already cold-starts a real dock over libusb using
the vino driver's control-plane code. Between the three, the whole DisplayLink
stack becomes open.

> **Naming.** The kernel module identifies itself to userspace as `evdi` (DRM
> driver name, `/dev/dri/cardN`, the `/sys/devices/evdi` control node) because
> DLM and `libevdi` hard-code that name. Only the *project* is called revdi.

## Layout

| Path          | What it is | License |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| `module/`     | The Rust EVDI kernel module (`evdi.ko`). Virtual DRM/KMS display, EVDI private ioctls, USB-dock pairing, DDC/CI bridge, damage-tracked GRABPIX. | GPL-2.0 |
| `library/`    | `librevdi`: a Rust `cdylib` exposing the exact `evdi_lib.h` C ABI, installed as `libevdi.so.1`. | LGPL-2.1-or-later |
| `chimera/`    | The DLM-replacement rig: compiles the vino driver's kernel control-plane sources verbatim in userspace and drives a dock over libusb. See `chimera/README.md`. | GPL-2.0-or-later |
| `vino-driver/`| libusb transport for the dock (the `Dock` type chimera drives). | GPL-2.0-or-later |
| `vino-hdcp/`  | HDCP 2.2 helpers (certificate parsing, KDF) used by the bring-up tooling. | GPL-2.0-or-later |
| `kernel-shim/`| A userspace stand-in for the kernel prelude, so the vendored kernel sources compile unmodified. | GPL-2.0-or-later |

The module/library split mirrors upstream evdi: the module is GPL-2.0
(`MODULE_LICENSE("GPL")`), the library is LGPL-2.1-or-later so a proprietary
client may link it.

## Vendored kernel sources

This project is **standalone**: it builds and its tests pass with no kernel tree
checked out anywhere. It manages that by keeping its own copies of two sets of
files that are *edited in the kernel tree*:

| Vendored copy      | Upstream source              |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `module/*.rs`      | `drivers/gpu/drm/evdi/*.rs`  |
| `chimera/vino/*.rs`| `drivers/gpu/drm/vino/*.rs`  |

The kernel tree is authoritative. Refresh the copies with:

```sh
make sync KSRC=/path/to/drm-next       # defaults to ../drm
make check-sync                        # report drift, change nothing, exit 1 if any
```

Do not hand-edit a vendored file. `chimera`'s proofs are only worth anything
because it compiles the *literal* driver sources — a local edit here would make
them silently stop tracking the real driver, which is exactly the drift the rig
exists to rule out. Edit the kernel tree, then re-run `make sync`.

## Building

### Kernel module

The module consumes Rust DRM/KMS bindings that are not yet in a released kernel,
so it must be built against a kernel tree that has them (this project is
developed against `drm-next` + the vino bindings series):

```sh
export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm/22/bin:$PATH      # kernel Rust toolchain (clang/rustc)
make -C module KDIR=/path/to/drm-next
sudo make -C module modules_install KDIR=/path/to/drm-next
```

`modules_install` runs `depmod` for the target kernel (KDIR's release) itself,
so a separate `depmod -a` — which would target the *running* kernel, not the
one you installed into — is neither needed nor correct.

`LLVM=1` is passed automatically; a stock distro kernel without the bindings
will not build it.

### Library

Builds with the system Rust toolchain (1.77+), no kernel tree required:

```sh
make -C library
sudo make -C library install       # installs libevdi.so.{1.15.0,1} + libevdi.so
```

### Chimera

Builds with the system Rust toolchain, no kernel tree required (it uses the
vendored sources above). Needs libusb development headers for the `live` feature:

```sh
make chimera        # release build of chimera-coldstart (--features live)
make test           # the offline byte-exact proof vs captured DLM sessions
```

### Everything

```sh
make          KDIR=/path/to/drm-next   # module + library
sudo make install KDIR=/path/to/drm-next
```

## Using it with DisplayLinkManager

1. Install the module and library as above.
2. Make sure the stock C `libevdi.so.1` is not shadowing ours (this replaces it
   at the same path/SONAME).
3. `modprobe evdi`, then start the DisplayLinkManager service. Plug in the dock;
   DLM opens `/dev/dri/cardN`, connects with the monitor's EDID, and drives the
   virtual display — revdi tracks damage and hands back only the changed
   rectangles per frame.

## Emergency stop / unloading the module

If something goes wrong (a wedged client, a card that will not tear down on
unplug, a suspected driver bug), the safe order is:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop displaylink-driver      # or otherwise stop DLM cleanly
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/evdi/remove_all
sudo rmmod evdi
```

`remove_all` unplugs every card in one shot without holding the registry lock
across the (sleeping) DRM/I2C teardown, and it is safe even while clients still
hold the DRM nodes: the cards are unplugged, not freed under them, so every
subsequent ioctl returns `ENODEV` and any in-kernel waiter (e.g. a pending
DDC/CI transfer) is woken and bails out instead of stalling the teardown. Once
the last client closes its file descriptors the module refcount drops to zero
and `rmmod evdi` succeeds. (`rmmod` while a client still has the node open is
refused with `EBUSY` by design — that is the kernel protecting you from a
use-after-free, not a hang.)

The same drain-then-drop path runs automatically when a dock is unplugged
(`USB_DEVICE_REMOVE` notifier) and when a single platform device unbinds.

## Status

**Module + library:** working end-to-end on a Dell D6000 under KWin/Wayland:
multi-head output, live frame updates with delta damage, hardware cursor, DDC/CI,
and clean teardown on dock unplug. See `docs/` for the design notes and the
kernel-tree patch set.

**Chimera:** not a DLM replacement yet. The control-plane half is real — it
cold-starts a dock over libusb and the dock engages — but nothing here paints a
desktop unattended. See `chimera/README.md` for exactly what is and is not proven.

## License

Dual-licensed by component, matching upstream evdi: the kernel module under
**GPL-2.0**, the library under **LGPL-2.1-or-later**. Each file carries an
`SPDX-License-Identifier`. Full texts are in `LICENSES/`.
