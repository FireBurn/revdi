# Sync revdi's vendored copies of the kernel sources from a kernel tree.
#
# revdi is a standalone project: it builds and tests without a kernel tree
# checked out next to it. It does that by keeping its own copies of two sets of
# kernel files:
#
#   module/*.rs        the EVDI module itself, built out-of-tree as evdi.ko
#   chimera/vino/*.rs  the vino driver's control-plane/codec sources, which
#                      chimera compiles VERBATIM in userspace (see chimera/README.md)
#
# The kernel tree is upstream of both: it is where those files are edited and
# where they get built into vmlinux/vino.ko. This script copies changes from
# there into this project, so a standalone checkout can be refreshed with one
# command instead of a hand-diff.
#
# Only the .rs sources are copied. Each side keeps its own build glue -- the
# kernel tree has Kconfig and an in-tree Makefile, revdi has module/Kbuild and
# an out-of-tree Makefile -- and those must not overwrite each other.
#
#   ./scripts/sync-kernel-sources.sh [--check] [KDIR]
#
#     --check   report drift and exit non-zero if any, copying nothing.
#               Suitable for CI or a pre-release gate.
#     KDIR      kernel tree to sync from. Defaults to $KDIR, then to ../drm
#               (the layout inside the dl-scripts working repo).
#
# Exit status: 0 in sync / synced, 1 drift found (--check), 2 usage or bad tree.
